Google Apps + WordPress Plugin
-----------------------
Connect the power of WordPress to the Google Apps ecosystem. Build sites, manage campaigns, and market your business with the Google Apps + WordPress Plugin. Google Docs embedding, Picasa Photo sharing, Google Calendar scheduling, and more... install it on your own domain! e5: Google Apps + WordPress is designed for WordPress multisite networks. We are working on an update to include single site installations.

-----------------------

1. Install the plugin as you would any other WordPress Plugin; it currently only works with multi-site installations in both subdomain and subdirectory modes (the plugin is the 'google-apps-wordpress' directory).
2. Next, you must create a Google Apps Marketplace application and install the Application Manifest. Make sure to update the manifest with your site information (replace e5.io in the manifest .txt file).
3. Complete the Installation process through the Google Apps Marketplace and create your default site. Your Google Apps users will now have access to your WordPress.
